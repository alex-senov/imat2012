Terms:
  Q - query
  C - click
  S - switch
  D - document
  D1...D10 - ten documents on SERP

Features:
  Implemented:
	1. session time
	2. number of Q
	3. number of C
	4. mean time between C and C
	5. max time between C and C
	6. mean time between Q and C
        7. max time between Q and C
        8. min time between Q and C
        9. min time between C and C
	10. number of S
	11. ?? ratio of Q without any C (for user?? or for session?)
	12. mean session time for user
	13. ?? Number_of_QCC_groups
	14. ?? Mean_Time_QCS
	15. ?? Max_Time_QCS
	

  Candidates:
	1. highest D clicked (1 to 10)
	2. lowest D clicked
	3. number (or ratio) of D double-clicked (clicked > 1 time)
	4. somehow calculate intersection between documents in different Queries 
	(if user change query a little than query result would change a little too)
	5. all features could be calculated for user to:
		mean number of Q for user
		mean min time between Q and C for user
		max mean session time for user
		....
